# ShutUpWesleyBot
A simple Reddit bot written with Python3 and PRAW that tells u/Wesley_Ford to shut up!

## Important Notes
I'd recommend that nobody run this exact bot (unless my server goes down) because we don't want to get in trouble for spamming Wesley *too* extensively. However, if you would like to assist in the development of this bot or change up the code for another purpose, be my guest!

## Use
Before this bot will function, you must do a few things.\
1.) Create a new account for the bot to run on, unless you want it to post with your personal Reddit account.\
2.) While signed into the new account, go to the [Reddit app preferences](https://reddit.com/prefs/apps) and create a new "script" app for the bot to run on.\
3.) Edit the file called "praw.ini" in the root directory of the code to use your bot's authentication details. Make sure to follow [these instructions](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html) to fill the file out, and place your settings under the site "bot1".
